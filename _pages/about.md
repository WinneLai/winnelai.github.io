I am a second-year Ph.D. candidate at [The Hong Kong Polytechnic University](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/), under the supervision of Prof. [Qing Li](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/comp/people/academic-staff/prof-li-qing/). I have been working closely with Prof. [Guandong Xu](https://profiles.uts.edu.au/Guandong.Xu) and Prof. [Haoran Xie](https://xiehaoran.net/). Before that, I received my Master's degree in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering from the National University of Singapore, under the supervision of Prof. [Haizhou Li](https://www.colips.org/~eleliha/).

My research interest lies in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Affective Computing (AC), primarily focusing on Sentiment Analysis and Large Language Models (LLMs) Reasoning.
